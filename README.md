Telerik has built extensions for JustCode to demonstrate usage of the public JustCode API and to collect individual contributions for JustCode in one package. These extensions are open sourced and licensed under MS-PL. You are welcome to use this project as the basis for creating your own.

NOTE: Recently we upgraded JustCode (from version 2013.3.912.2) for .NET Framework 4.0 and also reworked a bit the way JustCode integrates with Visual Studio (the biggest change is that we now use the MEF infrastructure provided directly from Visual Studio) and that caused some breaking changes in our extensions API. To fix your extensions you need to do the following changes:
 - Change the [assembly: SupportsCodeModelApiVersion(2)] in your AssemblyInfo to [assembly: SupportsCodeModelApiVersion(3)]
 - Change the reference to System.ComponentModel.Composition in JustCode binaries to the 4.0 one shipped with .NET
 - Build your extensions for .NET 4.0

We'll shortly update the extensions in this repository as well.

Prerequisites
-------
  - Microsoft Visual Studio: http://msdn.microsoft.com
  - The Visual Studio SDK: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/vstudio/vextend
  - Telerik JustCode: http://www.telerik.com/products/justcode.aspx
 
How to use this project
-------
  1. Get the sample source code and open JustCodeExtensions.sln inside Visual Studio.
  2. By default JustCode.Navigation project is set as startup, but you can change it to anyone else.
   - Right click the startup project in the VS Solution Explorer and enter Properties dialog.
   - In the Debug tab set 'Start external program' to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio **\<VS version\>**\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe where **\<VS version\>** should be replaced with e.g. (10.0 **|** 11.0 **|** 12.0).
   - Set **/rootsuffix Exp** as a 'Command line argumets'.
  3. Run/Debug the solution. Another Visual Studio instance will start with the sample extensions loaded by JustCode. 
  4. You can test the extensions inside the started Visual Studio instance. Currently, the samples include
   - JustCode.Analyzers: Custom analyzers that make JustCode show additional warnings
   - JustCode.Cleaning: Custom code cleaning steps that are available as part of [JustCode's **Clean Code**](http://www.telerik.com/help/justcode/code-cleaning-clean-code.html) feature
   - JustCode.Navigation: Custom navigation features, that are available in [JustCode's **Navigate**](http://www.telerik.com/help/justcode/code-navigation-and-search.html) Visual Aid section
 You can add additional commands, analyzers or code cleaning steps inside the existing Github project. 
 
Create your own project
------
 You can create your own JustCode extension project using the [Visual Studio template](http://www.telerik.com/help/justcode/reference-custom-justcode-extension.html) that is installed as part of JustCode.

Distribution of your own project
------
 JustCode extensions can be packaged and distributed as Visual Studio Extensions in the [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/). Search for *JustCode* there and you'll find some of the samples published in this project.
